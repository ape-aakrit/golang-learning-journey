# Golang Learning Journey for DevOps 🚀

Welcome to my **Golang Learning Journey for DevOps** – a practical, hands-on exploration of the Go programming language with a focus on building tools, automation, and cloud-native solutions used in modern DevOps workflows.

---

## 💡 Why Go for DevOps?

Go is the backbone of many cloud-native tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Prometheus, and more. Its simplicity, speed, concurrency model, and static binary compilation make it a perfect fit for DevOps tooling.

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here

- 🛠️ Go fundamentals with a DevOps twist  
- 📄 CLI tools, automation scripts, and microservices in Go  
- 🧰 Mini-projects inspired by real-world DevOps scenarios  
- 💡 Notes on Go idioms and best practices in tooling  
- 🧪 Experiments with HTTP servers, JSON APIs, and shell integrations

## 🧭 Learning Roadmap

> A DevOps-focused breakdown of Go topics and practical use cases:

1. **Go Basics** – Syntax, variables, control flow, functions  
2. **Structs & Interfaces** – The building blocks of reusable components  
3. **Concurrency with Goroutines & Channels** – Writing efficient automation  
4. **File & OS Interactions** – Shell scripting and process management  
5. **Building CLI Tools** – Creating powerful DevOps utilities  
6. **HTTP & REST APIs** – Writing lightweight APIs and webhooks  
7. **JSON & YAML Parsing** – Configuration handling in cloud-native apps  
8. **Working with Docker & Kubernetes APIs** – Automating infra with Go  
9. **Testing & Benchmarking** – Ensuring reliability and performance  
10. **Go Modules & Packages** – Clean project structure and dependency management
